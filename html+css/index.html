        <h2>Here's a timeline of Barbara Liskov life.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Liskov was born November 7, 1939, in Los Angeles, California,[4] to a Jewish family</li>
            <p>She earned her BA in mathematics with a minor in physics at the University of California, Berkeley in 1961. In her 
                classes she had one other female classmate, the rest were male.[6] After she graduated she applied to graduate 
                mathematics programs at Berkeley and Princeton. At the time Princeton was not accepting female students in mathematics.[7] 
                She was accepted at Berkeley but instead of studying she moved to Boston and began working at Mitre Corporation. It was there that she became interested in computers and programming. She worked at Mitre for one year before taking a programming job at Harvard where she worked on language translation.[7]</p>
            <li>She was on the inaugural Engineering and Computer Science jury for the Infosys Prize in 2009.</li>

            <li>In 2004, Barbara Liskov won the John von Neumann Medal for "fundamental contributions to programming languages, programming methodology, and distributed systems"</li>
